## Project Background & Objective

Our project centers around the crucial need to engage the local community of Regina, Saskatchewan, in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The primary objective is to cultivate a platform that educates, informs, and motivates residents and potential newcomers about the significant challenges that need attention and action. 

By developing a website that not only serves as an educational tool but also as a hub for active involvement, we aim to:

- **Educate** the community about pressing issues.
- **Encourage** participation and involvement in initiatives that support the SDGs.
- **Provide** resources for residents and potential residents evaluating the city.
- **Develop** a specific SDG mapping component tailored for Regina to aid officials and professionals in making informed decisions and to offer the general public insights into community progress.
