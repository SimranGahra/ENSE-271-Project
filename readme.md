## Summarized project background & business need/opportunity:
Our project's main objective is to raise awareness and involvement in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Regina, Saskatchewan. We plan to achieve this by creating a comprehensive website that educates the local community about the most pressing issues that require change. This website will also serve as a resource for potential residents evaluating the city. Additionally, we aim to develop a specific component that will focus on SDG mapping for Regina. This component will target officials and professionals capable of using the data for actionable change. At the same time, it will provide the general public with insights into community progress, volunteer opportunities, and resources for activ involvement in achieving these goals.
